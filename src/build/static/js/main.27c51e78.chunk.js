For that, you may also have a quick look at this short video:","Microsoft .net and Java are two famous technologies with the help of which you can build software, websites, and web apps. As both these languages are famous in their own place, so, it usually becomes difficult for businesses to choose which language is best to choose as a primary development tool in order to create intuitive applications. With the help of both these technologies, you can create large-scale business applications.","Before doing a comparison between these two, you should know about the applications created using either of the technologies. Yes! There is no doubt that in this piece of article, we are going to do the comparison here but our main motive is to make the businesses understand which option is much better for them according to their operational requirements.","The Core Differences between Java and .NET","One of the major differences between Java and .Net is that Java, usually Java Enterprise Edition is able to work on any operating system, on the other hand, .Net is able to work only on various versions of Windows.

They do not tell about all the features, and often publish the same false information.\n            Let's try to understand the protocol, the capabilities of Bluetooth stacks, headphones and speakers, Bluetooth codecs for music and speech, find out what affects the quality of the transmitted audio and the delay, learn how to capture and decode information about supported codecs and other device features.","Music via Bluetooth","The functional components of Bluetooth are defined by profiles\u2014documented features formalized in specifications. Bluetooth music is transmitted using a high-quality audio A2DP transmission profile. The A2DP standard was adopted in 2003, and has not changed drastically since then.\n            The profile standardize one mandatory codec\u2014SBC, a low computational complexity codec created specifically for Bluetooth, and 3 additional codecs. One can also use vendor-specific codecs of your own implementation, not included into A2DP.","Bluetooth Data Transfer","There are two types of data transfer in Bluetooth: Asynchronous Connection Less (ACL) for asynchronous transfer without establishing a connection, and Synchronous Connection Oriented (SCO), for synchronous transfer with connection establishment.\n            Data transmission uses time-division scheme and changes frequency channel for each transmitted data packet (Frequency-Hop/Time-Division-Duplex, FH/TDD). The time is divided into 625 microsecond intervals, called slots. One of the devices transmits in even numbers of slots, the other\u2014in odd numbers. A transmitted packet can occupy 1, 3 or 5 slots, depending on the size of the data and the transmission mode. If the packet is big enough and more than one slot transmission mode is used, the data is carried out in even and odd slots until the end of the transmission. In one second you can receive and send up to 1600 packets if each of them occupies 1 slot and both devices continuously transmit and receive data."]},{name:"nvidia-geforce",title:"The hunt for vulnerability: executing arbitrary code on NVIDIA GeForce NOW virtual machines",content:["Introduction","Against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, the demand for cloud gaming services has noticeably increased. These services provide computing power to launch video games and stream gameplay to user devices in real-time. The most obvious advantage of this gaming type is that gamers do not need to have high-end hardware. An inexpensive computer is enough to run the client, spending time in self-isolation while the remote server carries out all calculations.","NVIDIA GeForce NOW is one of these cloud-based game streaming services. According to Google Trends, worldwide search queries for GeForce NOW peaked in February 2020. This correlates with the beginning of quarantine restrictions in many Asian, European, and North and South American countries, as well as other world regions. At the same time in Russia, where the self-isolation regime began in March, we see a similar picture with a corresponding delay.","Given the high interest in GeForce NOW, we decided to explore this service from an information security standpoint.","Exploring the platform","When we began our research, GeForce NOW offered two membership options \u2014 free and the so-called Founders membership, which was available on a subscription basis. The free version has some limitations; for example, a player may have to wait in a queue to access servers. The paid version offers priority access and the player usually does not need to wait for available virtual machines. Both versions provide an identical security level. If the player somehow violates the service\u2019s terms of use, runtime immediately shuts down and the guilty gamer\u2019s account can be banned.","The menu contains a list of games supported by the service. To play a game, the gamer needs an account from one of the digital distribution services with a particular game linked to it. If the game is paid, it must be purchased in advance. In this study, we examine GeForce NOW in conjunction with the Steam digital store.","Upon clicking \u201cPlay\u201d, a remote virtual environment is launched in the main window and real-time streaming from the server to the user's device begins.","If the selected game has already been purchased, it will run in full-screen mode and other features of the virtual environment should not be available to the player. However, if the game settings allow the game to be launched in the windowed mode, it becomes possible to access the Steam library. Another way to access the library is to select a game that is not yet present in the catalog."]}],v=function(){return o.a.createElement(o.a.Fragment,null,o.a.createElement("h1",null,"Articles"),o.a.createElement(f,{articles:g}))},w=a(6),b=a.n(w),y=a(9),E=a(11),k=function(e){var t=e.comments;return o.a.createElement(o.a.Fragment,null,o.a.createElement("h3",null,"Comments:"),t.map((function(e,t){return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"comment",key:t},o.a.createElement("h4",null,e.username),o.a.createElement("p",null,e.text))})))},I=function(e){var t=e.articleName,a=e.upvotes,n=e.setArticleInfo,i=function(){var e=Object(y.a)(b.a.mark((function e(){var a,o;return b.a.wrap((function(e){for(;;)switch(e.prev=e.next){case 0:return e.next=2,fetch("/api/articles/".concat(t,"/upvote"),{method:"post"});case 2:return a=e.sent,e.next=5,a.json();case 5:o=e.sent,n(o);case 7:case"end":return e.stop()}}),e)})));return function(){return e.apply(this,arguments)}}();return o.a.createElement("div",{id:"upvotes-section"},o.a.createElement("button",{onClick:function(){return i()}},"Add Upvote"),o.a.createElement("p",null,"This post has been upvoted ",a," times"))},A=function(e){var t=e.articleName,a=e.setArticleInfo,i=Object(n.useState)(""),r=Object(E.a)(i,2),s=r[0],l=r[1],c=Object(n.useState)(""),u=Object(E.a)(c,2),h=u[0],d=u[1],m=function(){var e=Object(y.a)(b.a.mark((function e(){var n,o;return b.a.wrap((function(e){for(;;)switch(e.prev=e.next){case 0:return e.next=2,fetch("/api/articles/".concat(t,"/add-comment"),{method:"post",body:JSON.stringify({username:s,text:h}),headers:{"Content-Type":"application/json"}});case 2:return n=e.sent,e.next=5,n.json();case 5:o=e.sent,a(o),l(""),d("");case 9:case"end":return e.stop()}}),e)})));return function(){return e.apply(this,arguments)}}();return o.a.createElement("div",{id:"add-comment-form"},o.a.createElement("h3",null,"Add a Comment"),o.a.createElement("label",null,"Name:",o.a.createElement("input",{type:"text",value:s,onChange:function(e){return l(e.target.value)}})),o.a.createElement("label",null,"Comment:",o.a.createElement("textarea",{rows:"4",cols:"50",value:h,onChange:function(e){return d(e.target.value)}})),o.a.createElement("button",{onClick:function(){return m()}},"Add Comment"))},O=function(){return o.a.createElement("h1",null,"404: Page Not Found")},T=function(e){var t=e.match.params.name,a=g.find((function(e){return e.name===t})),i=Object(n.useState)({upvotes:0,comments:[]}),r=Object(E.a)(i,2),s=r[0],l=r[1];if(Object(n.useEffect)((function(){(function(){var e=Object(y.a)(b.a.mark((function e(){var a,n;return b.a.wrap((function(e){for(;;)switch(e.prev=e.next){case 0:return e.next=2,fetch("/api/articles/".concat(t));case 2:return a=e.sent,e.next=5,a.json();case 5:n=e.sent,l(n);case 7:case"end":return e.stop()}}),e)})));return function(){return e.apply(this,arguments)}})()()}),[t]),!a)return o.a.createElement(O,null);var c=g.filter((function(e){return e.name!==t}));return o.a.createElement(o.a.Fragment,null,o.a.createElement("h1",null,a.title),a.content.map((function(e,t){return o.a.createElement("p",{key:t},e)})),o.a.createElement(I,{articleName:t,upvotes:s.upvotes,setArticleInfo:l}),o.a.createElement(k,{comments:s.comments}),o.a.createElement(A,{articleName:t,setArticleInfo:l}),o.a.createElement("h3",null,"Other Articles:"),o.a.createElement(f,{articles:c}))},j=function(){return o.a.createElement("nav",null,o.a.createElement("ul",null,o.a.createElement("li",null,o.a.createElement(h.b,{to:"/"},"Home")),o.a.createElement("li",null,o.a.createElement(h.b,{to:"/about"},"About")),o.a.createElement("li",null,o.a.createElement(h.b,{to:"/articles-list"},"Articles"))))},x=(a(36),function(e){Object(c.a)(a,e);var t=Object(u.a)(a);function a(){return Object(s.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(l.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return o.a.createElement(h.a,null,o.a.createElement("div",{className:"App"},o.a.createElement(j,null),o.a.createElement("div",{id:"page-body"},o.a.createElement(d.c,null,o.a.createElement(d.a,{path:"/",component:m,exact:!0}),o.a.createElement(d.a,{path:"/about",component:p}),o.a.createElement(d.a,{path:"/articles-list",component:v}),o.a.createElement(d.a,{path:"/article/:name",component:T}),o.a.createElement(d.a,{component:O})))))}}]),a}(n.Component));Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));r.a.render(o.a.createElement(x,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))}},[[23,1,2]]]);
